The scripts are working, but not fully tested yet. My goal is to create a chat bot working on a neural network. I assumed that I would introduce ready-made sentence structures as input data. The project works in Polish.

The scripts in this version are just a simple neural network for part-of-speech verification, but they don't work the way I wanted them to.

run python le_START_LEARNING.py

                -t True voice recorder is ON
                
                -m True mediaWords are ON
                
                -b True:OBS / SL chatBot are ON
